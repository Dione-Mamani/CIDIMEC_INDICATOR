# CIDIMEC_INDICATOR
Digital Dial Number Recognition
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing numerical values displayed on a digital dial indicator. The model processes images of the dial, extracting and identifying the numbers shown.

Key Features:
Image Processing: Utilizes techniques like image segmentation and pre-processing to enhance dial images.
Number Recognition: Implements a machine learning model to accurately detect and classify numbers from the processed images.
Dataset: Contains labeled images of digital dials used for training and testing the model.
Easy Integration: The code is modular and can be integrated into broader systems for industrial or monitoring applications.
